# ‚ú® Description

This project provides a lightweight but powerful tool for converting raw image data into the more common and widely supported BMP (Bitmap) image format. It's perfect for quickly viewing or processing raw image data from various sources, such as camera sensors or other imaging devices, without the need for heavy software.

# ‚úÖ Key Features

- Fast Conversion: Quickly transforms raw image files into 24-bit BMP images.

- Command-Line Interface: Easy to use for scripting and automation.

- Cross-Platform: Compiles and runs smoothly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

- Lightweight: No external dependencies needed, just a C++ compiler!

# üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get the script up and running on your local machine.

## üîß Prerequisites

    Python 3.6+

    pip (Python package installer)

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Bash

## Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

    Clone the repository:
    Bash

git clone https://github.com/totallynotmanas/raw-to-bmp.git
cd raw-to-bmp

Install the required packages:
(You'll need to create a requirements.txt file listing your dependencies, for example:)
Plaintext

## requirements.txt
Pillow
numpy

Then run the installer:
Bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

To convert a file, run the Python script with the input file, output file, and the image dimensions.

Command Syntax

Bash

python main.py <input_file.raw> <output_file.bmp> <width> <height>

Argument	Description
<input_file.raw>	The path to the source raw image file.
<output_file.bmp>	The desired name for the output BMP file.
<width>	The width of the image in pixels.
<height>	The height of the image in pixels.

Example

Bash

python main.py my_image.raw converted_image.bmp 1920 1080

This command reads my_image.raw and creates a new 1920x1080 BMP file named converted_image.bmp.
